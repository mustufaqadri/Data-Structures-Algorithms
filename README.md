## Introduction

As a passionate coder and enthusiast of algorithms and data structures, I've created this repository to:

- Document my progress in solving LeetCode problems.
- Share my solutions with the community.
- Receive feedback and learn from others.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions as a reference. If you notice any issues, have improvements to suggest, or want to contribute your solutions, please read the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Each problem has its own directory within the `Problems` folder, containing the problem statement, my solution(s), and a README file with explanations, time complexity analysis, and any relevant notes.

## LeetCode Solutions

Here's a list of the LeetCode problems I've tackled so far:

1. [Fibonacci Number:](./src/basic/Fibonacci.java) https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/description
2. [Frequency Count:](./src/basic/FrequencyCount.java) This program will count the occurrences of a digit in the given number.
3. [Reverse Number:](./src/basic/ReverseNumber.java) This program will reverse the given number.
4. [Prime Number:](./src/basic/PrimeNumber.java) This program will tell whether the given number is prime or not.
5. [Armstrong Number:](./src/basic/ArmstrongNumber.java) This program will tell whether the given number is armstrong or not.
